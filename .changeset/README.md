# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by
`@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or
single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the
full documentation for it
[in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this
project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Pre release

[Link to the pre-release version of the documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/prereleases.md)

In this case, we are looking at an alpha release. We start by entering into the
pre-release mode:

- `changeset pre enter <tag>`
  - alpha
- `changeset add`
  - choose what packages to version bump
- `changeset version`
  - this will bump the version of the packages

## Tags

`changeset tag` will create a tag for the current version of the packages. Tags
are also created when you run `changeset publish`. You will need to push those
tags via `git push --follow-tags`.
